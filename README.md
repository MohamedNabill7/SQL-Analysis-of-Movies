# SQL-Analysis-of-Movies
Aim of this repo  is use SQL to analyze the movies dataset and creating insights from findings.

## Introduction

	I've decided to analyze movies produced between 1980 and 2020. I've gathered data from Kaggle, cleaned the data using excel, and imported it into SQL Server.
	
## Dataset
  
  Click <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalva /movies?resource=download'> here </a> to access the dataset. 

	There are 6820 movies in the dataset (220 movies per year, 1986-2016). Each movie has the following attributes:
	budget: the budget of a movie. Some movies don't have this, so it appears as 0
	company: the production company
	country: country of origin
	director: the director
	genre: main genre of the movie.
	gross: revenue of the movie
	name: name of the movie
	rating: rating of the movie (R, PG, etc.)
	released: release date (YYYY-MM-DD)
	runtime: duration of the movie
	score: IMDb user rating
	votes: number of user votes
	star: main actor/actress
	writer: writer of the movie
	year: year of release
