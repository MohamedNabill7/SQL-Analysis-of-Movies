# SQL-Analysis-of-Movies
Aim of this repo  is use SQL to analyze the movies dataset and creating insights from findings.

## Introduction

	I've decided to analyze movies produced between 1980 and 2020. I've gathered data from Kaggle, cleaned the data using excel, and imported it into SQL Server.

	This project's main aim is to use SQL to analyze the movie dataset and answer a few questions. Click <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalva /movies?resource=download'> here </a> to access the dataset.
